    <string name="long_about">This app was built by Bill Cattey but builds on work from many sources.\n\n
The ButtonGridView comes from a Tutorial by Ivan Memruk appearing on his blog, &quot;Mind the Robot.&quot;\n
See: &quot;Android Beatz: Making a Drum Machine App&quot;
at: http://mindtherobot.com/blog/420/android-beatz-making-a-drum-machine-app/\n\n
The button bitmaps are derived from the graphics Rich Dellinger did in photoshop for the
Simon Extreme program for the Mac.  (I cut apart the .psd image file he gave as an example.)

I was able to achieve the extremely accurate mimic of the Simon game behavior because of the
meticulously detailed reverse engineering done by Simon Inns documented on his website at:
http://www.waitingforfriday.com/index.php/Reverse_engineering_an_MB_Electronic_Simon_game\n\n
And of course, the game itself, its design, layout, action and name are properly credited to
Milton Bradley / Hasbro which owns the game, and to the genius of Ralph Baer who conceived of
and implemented the game.  See: http://www.dieterkoenig.at/ccc/english/se_story_simon.htm\n\n
The Simon name is a registered trademark of the Milton Bradley Hasbro Corporation.\n\n
The game is covered by US Patent 4207087, issued 10 June 1980.\n
